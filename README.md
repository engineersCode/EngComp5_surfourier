# Engineering Computations Module 5

_Engineering Computations_ is a collection of stackable learning modules, flexible for adoption in different situations.
It aims to develop computational skills for students in engineering, but it can also be used by students in other science majors.
The course uses the Python programming language and the Jupyter open-source tools for interactive computing.

## Module 5: Transform all the waves

*Manipulate complex numbers using Python. Explore information in wave form, programmatically and through visualization. Apply Fourier analysis on wave-like data.*

**Pre-requisites: learning modules [*EngComp 1*](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp1_offtheground) and [*EngComp 4*](https://github.com/engineersCode/EngComp4_landlinear) of our collection.**

### [Lesson 0](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp5lesson0): The simplicity of the complex

What are complex numbers? Visualize it! Play with complex numbers in Python. Functions of complex numbers. Euler's formula. 
*Geometry of complex numbers*â€” The conjugate is a reflection. Geometry of multiplication and De Moivre's formula. Reciprocal and division. Patterns i^n.

### [Lesson 1](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp5lesson0): Untangle any waveform

What is sound? Waveforms. Play with audio in Python. Read and write audio files. Understanding the Fourier transform.
