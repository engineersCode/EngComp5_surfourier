    "Welcome to a new lesson of the _Engineering Computations_ series, where we use computing as our instrument to discover the world. In this lesson, we explore information in wave form, using sound as a prototypical example. We aim to bring to light how engineers and scientists are able to analyze this kind of data, which has a myriad interesting applications. Let's go!"

    "\n",
    "Physically, _sound_ means travelling vibrations in any medium: air, water, metal, anything that can support oscillations. When your vocal chords emit sound, they are literally vibrating and passing on that vibration to the air around them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine pressure vibrations in the air like longitudinal waves on a slinky, as shown on this gif (you can watch the full [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIkeGBXqWW0) on YouTube).\n",

    "\n",
    "Every loop of the spiral just oscillates around a position of equilibrium, while the _wave_ of compressions and expansions travels the length of the slinky. In the air, sound also travels as longitudinal compression/rarefaction waves."

The array is defined using the length of time from zero to `length_sec` (in seconds) and a _sampling rate_, the number of time samples per second. Study the code below."
