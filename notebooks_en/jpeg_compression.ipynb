    "## Compression image and the Fast Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is based on the Image Compression youtube lessons from Steve Barton:\n",
    "- [Image compreesion and FFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGEBUdM0PVc&ab_channel=SteveBrunton)\n",

    "The Fourier transform as we saw in the past lessons, is a transform that decompose a function in terms of sines and cosines, and we can compute the coefficents efficiently using the \"fast fourier transform\" algorithm. Luckly, this algorithm is already a built in function in `numpy` so we can go ahead and use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common applications of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is compression, compression of audio, video, images, etc. In this notebook we will see an example of image compression, for which we will use a 2D fast fourier transform `fft2`. The idea behind a two-dimensional FFT is  that we applied FFT to all the rows and then to all the columns of our 2D image. Fortunately, `numpy` already has a 2D fft implementation `numpy.fft.fft2` that we will apply to our pixels and get the fourier coefficients of our image. Most of this coefficients will be very small and we will be able to discard them and keep the higher ones. We will see that by just keeping a small percentage of coefficients we can recover the original image by applying the inverse of the FFT. This process is what is behind all types of compressions compression. For real applications wavelets transforms are implemented since they give better results, but the process behind is the same. Let's take a look in an actual example.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are saving a JPG image in our phones or computers we are saving only the small percentage of pixels that recovers the image, which can be display very fast thanks to the inverse FFT.\n"
